## About the Project

This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model using Flask. Users can input their age via a webpage, and the application predicts if they are eligible for insurance. The goal is to provide a hands-on example of integrating ML models with a web interface for real-world usage.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive HTML-based webpage for user input.
- Backend powered by Flask for serving the ML model.
- Predicts insurance eligibility based on age.
- Lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- Machine Learning Model (e.g., scikit-learn)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-deployment-flask.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ml-deployment-flask
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
